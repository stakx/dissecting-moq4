Dissecting moq 4
================

This repository was forked from [moq/moq4](https://github.com/moq/moq4)
around version 4.15.2.

It is an experiment in reducing Moq 4 to a smaller set of core features
by removing "convenience" features one after another, and documenting
the process along the way.
